INTRODUCTION                                    *HexmodeIntroduction*

Many advanced text editors allow the editing of files in a "hex
mode," especially useful for editing binary files.  Vim provides this
capability through the external program xxd, which is included by
default in standard distributions of Vim.  Unfortunately, using an
external program for this task is non-intuitive and error-prone.  A
user must remember how to run the filter, must remember to convert
back from hex before saving, cannot convert read-only files without
warnings, and more.

The hexmode plugin improves the use of xxd to edit hex files by
adding a mapping and command to easily toggle back and forth between
hex and non-hex mode, and automating tasks like converting back from
the hex-filtered form before saving a file.sh inherit $@



=====================================================================
USAGE AND MAPPINGS                          *HexmodeUsageAndMappings*

Use this command to toggle xxd on and off

    :Hexmode

Place the following into your vimrc to enable hexmode using
Control-H.  Be aware that <C-H> is already a defined command, so
override it with care (or use a different left hand side to the
mapping).

    nnoremap <C-H> :Hexmode<CR>
    inoremap <C-H> <Esc>:Hexmode<CR>
    vnoremap <C-H> :<C-U>Hexmode<CR>

By default, bin and hex files are automatically opened in hex mode.
Additional file patterns may be added by modifying the
g:hexmode_patterns variable in your vimrc:

    let g:hexmode_patterns += "*.jpg"
